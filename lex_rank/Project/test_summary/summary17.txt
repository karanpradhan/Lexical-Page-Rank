the taliban, who control about 90 percent of afghanistan, on friday closed their three-week inquiry into allegations that osama bin laden is waging a war of terror against the united states.the review, by the national security council, was the basis for saying this operation did not violate the presidential order banning assassinations.the legal review conducted by the white house would appear to provide a precedent for future operations in similar circumstances.
they were arrested under a 1974 law that allows police to detain any one for offenses related to national security, the officer said on condition of anonymity.but a less subtle explanation was offered on oct.under taliban rules women may not study or work outside their houses, and all kinds of light entertainment including music are banned.
