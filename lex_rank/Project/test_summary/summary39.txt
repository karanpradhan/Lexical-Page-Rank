hariri's cabinet has been serving in a caretaker capacity since lahoud's inauguration last tuesday.central bank officials on monday tried to calm fears about a run on the lebanese pound by announcing that the bank was ready to intervene with its foreign currency reserves if necessary, the state-run national news agency reported.although opposition to syria's hold on lebanon's politics is common among anti-syrian politicians, it is rare for somebody like jumblatt to openly speak against a decision personally cleared by syrian president hafez assad who keeps 30,000 troops in lebanon.but in the end, it is hariri that is most likely to be renamed on the strength of his record in office.
