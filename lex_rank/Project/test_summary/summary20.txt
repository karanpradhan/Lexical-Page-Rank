palestinian political leaders said israel should not use friday's suicide bombing, which killed the two assailants and wounded 21 israelis, as an excuse to stop the peace process.the palestinians said they could ban activity by hamas or islamic jihad that endangered either israelis or palestinians, but could not outlaw them outright as political movements.a small crowd of demonstrators shouted.the decision came less than three hours after a car rigged with explosives blew up in an outdoor market in downtown jersualem.although hamas initially claimed responsibility through anonymous phone calls to the police, all sides now have agreed that it was islamic jihad that carried it out.we have no knowledge in the movement about the operation that occurred in jerusalem, said nafez azzam, a senior leader of islamic holy war in gaza.
