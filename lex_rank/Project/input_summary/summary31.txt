it has been a difficult ally from the outset.prodi's backers are hoping that enough members of the communist refounding party will break ranks and follow cossutta to save the coalition.but throughout his tenure, he was forced to seek temporary alliances to push through major policy decisions.working in prodi's favor is the fact that few parties think they would stand to gain by early elections, including the communist refoundation.cossuta was clearly unwilling to join the most hard-line wing of his party in withdrawing support from prodi and risk being branded as having torpedoed the first leftist italian government in 50 years.unless the italian political system changes, italy is condemned to political instability, said sergio romano, a former diplomat and political science professor.
