iran's official media boasted about a huge turnout in elections friday for the council that oversees the country's supreme leader.although voting was supposed to be secret, there were no private booths for voters and it was easy to see whom a person voted for.final results are not expected until sunday.associated press reporters who toured polling stations in tehran friday also found many of them deserted.in practice, the supreme leader has the final say in all matters and hard-line clergymen want to keep it that way.definitely, there could have been more qualified people than were allowed, but nonetheless we still have a chance to choose our favored candidates, said khatami, who drove to the polling booth dressed in the clergy's black robe and turban.the electoral authorities twice extended closing the polls for a total of three hours.the council of guardians, which is dominated by political hard-liners, has rejected 214 candidates out of 400 who wanted to run in friday's election to the 86-member assembly of experts.there is no doubt that the number of wise and learned scholars suitable for membership of the assembly of experts is greater than the 400 or so candidates who have registered, the president said.she said she visited several polling stations and found very few people voting.iranians voted friday to elect a key assembly expected to be dominated by hard-line clergymen who favor unhindered powers for iran's supreme leader.the official media had reported crowded polling stations and a massive turnout, but visits to tehran stations showed many nearly empty and calls to other parts of the country produced similar reports.conservative muslim clerics were leading in national elections for a key assembly that elects and oversees iran's supreme leader, according to partial results saturday.many iranians said they stayed away to protest the dropping of most progressive theologians by the conservative-dominated council of guardians.many of the disqualified candidates were supporters of president mohammad khatami, a political moderate.the official media on friday claimed an unprecedented participation by voters.fewer than 10 million of a little more than 38 million eligible voters are expected to take part.it makes no difference.the stations were empty.they are all liars.official results are not expected until saturday, and tehran's results could be announced as late as sunday, electoral authorities said.
an election observer in western tehran said many voters had cast empty ballot papers and many more had voted for supporters of the moderate president mohammad khatami.so extensive was the boycott that the ruling clerics were speaking of religiously sanctioned rigging, the ncri said in a statement issued in washington and faxed to the associated press in cairo, egypt.golestan residents, contacted by telephone, disputed that.but khatami's camp appeared to have lost this battle even before the polls: a conservative supervisory council that vetted a list of 396 prospective candidates approved 161 contestants, only about 30 of them moderates.but moderate clerics led by president mohammad khatami are calling for a more accountable leader in a political tug-of-war that has gripped iran since his election last year.besides the presidential polls, the election for the 86-member assembly is the most important in iran because the caucus elects and supervises the country's supreme leader, who has the final say in government decisions.candidates have to take a test on islamic theology.voting in the 33,312 polling stations in the country's 28 provinces is scheduled to close at 6 p.m.-lrb- 1430 gmt-rrb-.in a reference to expectations of a low turnout, khatami said that greater variety among the candidates would have increased public enthusiasm for the polls.despite the urging, the lackluster election campaign has failed to draw much excitement because of lack of competition: most of the 161 candidates all clergymen are hard-liners who were selected by a supervisory council of guardians controlled by conservatives.the results came as no surprise since most moderates had been dropped from the ballot in advance of friday's election by a council that reviews candidates's eligibility and is dominated by hard-liners.hoping to save the day, supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei issued his final appeal wednesday.i am powerless to do anything against them so it's best to keep quiet, said siavaash mohseni, 24, a university student who said he didn't vote.but correspondents who visited a dozen polling stations around the capital found turnout to be minimal.among those urging people to vote was grand ayatollah kazem lankarani, who called it a divine duty and warned that the revolution's enemies are waiting to strike a strong blow at our regime.definitely, there could have been more qualified people than were allowed, but nonetheless we still have a chance to choose our favored candidates, khatami told reporters.iran's supreme leader, ayatollah ali khamenei, a hard-liner, has the final say in government, and conservative clerics want to keep it that way.khatami urged people to vote after casting his ballot at the husseinieh jamaran mosque in northern tehran.khatami went on national television late saturday to criticize the selection of the candidates for the assembly, which has the power to appoint or dismiss iran's supreme leader.the results were expected since most moderates had been dropped from the ballot in advance of friday's election by a council that reviews candidates's eligibility and is dominated by hard-liners.sixteen seats went to candidates whose political affiliation was unclear but who probably lean toward the hard-line camp and three to declared independents, who are believed to be closer the moderates.the committee said the 17 victors represent 12 of the country's 28 provinces.in bojnourd and astaneh ashrafiyeh cities in the north, people braved heavy rains and strong winds to stand in long lines at polling stations, the official islamic republic news agency said.in tehran's laleh park on sunday, thousands turned out to hear heshmatollah tabarzadi, a fiery student leader who spoke of the councilors that vetoed his own candidacy in friday's polls.nationwide, 40 percent of the 38.5 million electorate voted, the independent salam newspaper said quoting sources the interior ministry.the elections were marked by a low turnout, and many iranians said they stayed away to protest the lack of choice: a conservative council that vetted a list of 396 prospective candidates had rejected all but about 30 moderate candidates.these theologians, who control state institutions such as the judiciary and security agencies, cite the ideals of the 1979 islamic revolution that was led by khamenei's predecessor, ayatollah ruhollah khomeini.the behavior of the council of guardians was very insulting because they did not give us a chance to choose the candidates of our choice, she said.some moderate leaders had said in advance they did not expect to win the balloting but still hoped to use the assembly to focus on the growing powers granted to supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei, the country's top shiite muslim cleric.other moderates believe that people must vote to at least keep the most stringent hard-liners out of the assembly, such as mohammad yazdi, head of the judiciary, and ahmad jannati, head of the council of guardians.in vetting 396 aspirants, the council eliminated most supporters of president mohammad khatami, a moderate clergyman with wide popular support.only two polling stations had voters waiting in line.friday's election is for the 86-seat assembly of experts, whose job is to oversee the work of the supreme leader, a post currently held by ayatollah ali khamenei.the trend offered no surprise since most of the 167 candidates in friday' elections were hard-liners who want to maintain the authority of the supreme leader, the country's top shiite cleric who has the final say in all matters.state-controlled tehran radio reported unprecedented and unique voting levels for the 86-member assembly of experts.the moderates, led by popular president mohammad khatami, want to make the supreme leader more accountable to people by installing an assembly that is more balanced in its composition.the hard-liners won at least 54 places on the 86-seat assembly of experts and the moderates only 13.but many polling stations were nearly empty in tehran, the capital and largest city and where some voters complained that hard-line clerics had already decided the outcome.but moderate clerics, led by khatami, are calling for a more accountable leader.they have created a situation where a section of society will not be taking part in the elections because qualified candidates have been rejected, depriving a section of society from exercising their rights, tabarzadi said.
the election committee said a record 64.35 percent voter turnout was noted in golestan province.the results showed that only about 18 million of the 38.5 million eligible voters had bothered to cast ballots.people's participation is unprecedented and unique.in the capital, tehran, moderate former president hashemi rafsanjani led the polls with 1,682,882 votes.they have already selected the people they want to put in the assembly, said siavash mohseni, 24, a university student who didn't vote.some 100,000 security forces will be deployed around the country's 28 provinces for the voting in 33,312 polling stations.the hard-liners want to maintain khamenei's absolute authority and have battled khatami's efforts to grant more freedom to the press and the arts and reduce islamic strictures on the average citizen.
behind him was hard-liner ali meshkini, the current head of the assembly of experts, with 1,240,524 votes.the outcome is a blow to moderates who had hoped to use the assembly of experts to curb the absolute powers of the supreme leader and broaden social and political freedoms for the average iranian.the state-controlled media reported an unprecedented and unique turnout but gave no figures.interior minister abdolvahed lari also said late voters would not be turned away.thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators rallied in a tehran park sunday to protest the rejection of scores of candidates for the election of a powerful assembly.among the hard-liners who won in the capital were mohammad yazdi, head of the powerful judiciary, and ahmad jannati, who leads the council that vetted the candidates.a hard-line newspapers had said only about 39 percent of the 38 million eligible voters are expected to show up for friday's vote.ordinary people were blunt about their reason for boycotting the polls.the moderates also do not want their candidates few as they are to suffer because of a low turnout.we should not prevent people from criticizing the components of the system, the institutions, the president, the council of guardians, the islamic consultative assembly, the judiciary, khatami said.the conflict is the latest chapter in a pervasive power struggle in the ruling clergy between khatami and conservative clergymen who control most of the major state institutions such as the judiciary and security agencies.khatami said the council could be criticized for not creating the climate and conditions which would have attracted eligible individuals to enter the scene.however, a voter in tehran's enqelab square, saeid kazami, 41, said he had cast his ballot mainly for hard-line candidates because they are protectors of the-lrb- islamic-rrb- revolution.they have already selected the people they want to put in the assembly.however, associated press reporters found many polling stations empty and others with few voters.these theologians, who control most crucial state institutions such as the judiciary and security agencies, cite the ideals of the 1979 islamic revolution that was led by khamenei's predecessor, ayatollah ruhollah khomeini.the official islamic republic news agency said saturday that 51 percent of eligible voters cast their ballot in 12 provinces where counting has been completed.there was no independent confirmation of the claim and voters in iran did not openly complain of rigging.
people voted for islam, the radio said.even the hard-line abrar daily estimated that 15 million people will vote, a turnout of 39 percent.unfortunately, the procedures were such that competition was limited and a group of revolutionaries were prevented from taking part in the elections, ansari told the associated press.tehran radio said people queued in long lines to vote and authorities expect to run out of ballot papers.i will vote for somebody who will have some kind of influence over the-lrb- supreme-rrb- leader.khatami's followers want to make the supreme leader more accountable to the people while the hard-liners prefer a much more hands-off approach.but then the hard-liners began to fear a low turnout would look bad after some moderate groups decided to boycott the vote to protest the dumping of moderate candidates as well as to call into question the legitimacy of the conservatives.the upbeat reports contrasted with predictions of low voter turnout from a disappointed public that had little to choose from, unlike in the 1997 presidential polls when 20 million people voted for the reformist khatami.khatami's efforts to ease the revolution's social, political and media restrictions are popular.the people, by their huge turnout at the elections of the assembly of experts will inject a new life into the revolution, he said.a low turnout would likely be seen as a rebuff of the hard-line policies of khamenei, who succeeded the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini, the leader of the 1979 islamic revolution that installed the rule of shiite clergy in iran.a young woman who gave only her first name, arezou, said she was also alienated from the polls.khatami's popular efforts to ease the revolution's social, political and media restrictions are opposed bitterly by hard-liners loathe to give up control over iran's judiciary, security agencies and other key institutions.it said authorities stuffed ballot boxes and the regime planned to announce a turnout several times the actual figure.it said counting is underway for 69 remaining seats in 16 more provinces.the move by the 12-member council of guardians is seen as part of the struggle between conservatives and reformists in iran.the council reviewed a list of 396 applicants and allowed only 167 to run.the results showed that only about 18 million of the 38.5 million eligible voters had bothered to cast ballots.
twelve candidates withdrew their names in protest against the screening.but they are opposed bitterly by hard-liners who are loathe to give up control of key institutions such as the judiciary and the security agencies.fearing an embarrassing low turnout in a key election friday, senior conservative clerics fervently urged iranians to vote in large numbers to show confidence in the 19-year-old islamic regime.an opposition iranian group in exile, the national council of resistance in iran, claimed that only about 10 percent of the electorate voted.candidates linked to the moderate camp include former president hashemi rafsanjani and parliament member majid ansari, 44, who wants the assembly to submit regular reports of its work and to open its sessions to public.the council has rejected criticism, saying its sole criteria for judging candidates was the law.their affiliations were not given but judging by their background it was clear that at least 11 of the victors are hard-liners and four are moderates.the election committee announced the names of winners for 17 of the 86 seats in the assembly of experts.the radio said long lines of voters queued at polling stations across the country, and electoral officers expected to run out of ballot papers.she was reached by telephone in gorgan, capital of golestan.the candidates were selected by a council of guardians that is controlled by conservatives.since his elections last year, khatami has stunned the hard-liners with bold and popular attempts to ease social, political and media restrictions that were imposed after the 1979 islamic revolution installed the government of theologians.by eliminating the moderates for friday's assembly election, the conservatives were hoping to prevent a repeat of the stinging defeat in 1997 presidential election when 20 million out of 30 million people voted for khatami against a hard-line rival.first official results are not expected until saturday.
he shook hands and chatted with election officials before sitting in front of a white ballot box to pick a 16-man panel for the tehran district from a list of 32 candidates.iran's conservatives won a decisive victory in elections for a clergy-based assembly that oversees the country's supreme leader, official results showed sunday.we want to have a say in our destiny, said farhad qaemaqami, who waited with about 30 others to vote at a mosque in the upscale fereshteh neighborhood.khatami, who was among the early voters, pointed that out to reporters after casting his ballot in the husseinieh jamaran meeting hall attached to a mosque in northern tehran.how those ballots got there, i have no idea, said parvin, who would only give her first name.candidate majid ansari, a moderate cleric, blamed the low turnout in tehran on the lack of choice as most of the 167 candidates all clergymen were hard-liners.friday's voter turnout was in sharp contrast to last year's presidential elections, when some 30 million cast ballots, 20 million of whom voted for president mohammad khatami, who has presented the biggest challenge to the conservatives since the 1979 islamic revolution.hard-liners won 11 of the 16 seats in tehran and moderates only five.sixteen seats went to candidates whose political affiliation was unclear but who probably lean toward the hard-line camp and three to declared independents, who are believed to be closer to the moderates.the hard-line controlled state tehran radio spent half its hour long main news program thursday broadcasting calls for people to show their brave presence at polling stations to elect the assembly of experts.they also favor greater social, political and media freedom than allowed by the established clergy owing allegiance to supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei.two are believed to be independents.we know that the revolution will have no problem if they are in charge, he said.
